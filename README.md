# dg-stac
DigitalGlobe's work with the [STAC spec](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec).  

STAC is The SpationTemporal Asset Catalog which is a standardization of catalog records 
for easy search and readabiltiy.  The goal is for all major imagery data providers to 
adopt this standard and thereby make for common clients and usages of image discovery.

This repository is for efforts that DigitalGlobe is making in building the specification 
and adopting its usage.  We will place example records and items into this repo as well as 
other documents, utilities and tools.
